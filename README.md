# Automatic Picture Taking from Video Frames

Takes an input video as well as a few settings you can configure like start or end time, as well as the interval of the picutes, and outputs pictures into a new folder in the same directory as the input video. 

Note: This used to use FFMPEG which was faster but so some reason I could not figure out the pictures can out lower quality than the original video. Now it uses OpenCV.

This was a first time I had to make something for a non programmer to use so I learned a lot. My first gui, error handeling, user feadback, installation on other computers, "it works on my machine" types of problems. All 10/10 learning experiances.
